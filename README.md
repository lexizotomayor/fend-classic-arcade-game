# A Classic Arcade Game Clone Project 
This game challenges the player to move across the board from the bottom to the top and to avoid collisions with three constantly moving enemies with random speeds. 

## Basic Rules
The objective of the game is to move the player (in this case, the princess) from the starting row to the water. By crossing to the water 10 times, the player wins the game. 

The princess character can move left, right, up or down as she evades the moving enemies. Every single time she reaches the water, the enemies' speeds are increased to raise the level of difficulty. 

The player has, at his or her disposal, five lives. If these lives were used up even before reaching Level 10, the player has to restart the game and try again. 

There is no limit to the number of games the player can play.  

Should there be any bug in the game, contact the developer via [e-Mail](mailto:lexi@zotomayor.com).
